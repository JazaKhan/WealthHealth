# WealthHealth

## An engaging financial manager!

WealthHealth will allow users to track their **financal health** and formulate plans to **improve** it. It can be utilized by anyone, *including* university students. Although, it may will most likely be most beneficial to individuals with  a source of income. During my year working at a credit union, I came across many individuals that struggled with managing their resource. **Financial literacy** is something that is not commonly considered an important learning goal in schools, hence most young adults and even many adults tend to struggle with it. The goal of WealthHealth is to make money management easier, and to begin to educate individuals about the value and impact of their financial choices.
